# Introduction to BDD

## Repository context

This repositories was created in the context of creating a tutorial in Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). This also includes an installation guide, explaining the different configurations made, which can be found on the follwing page ->(INSERT LINK). This repository represents the practical example part of the tutorial and uses its branches to step by step add features and functionalities with explanation to the changes in contrast to the previous branches.

## What is BDD?
Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is an agile workprocess in software development, designed to strenghten the enhance the communication and teamwork between the qualitymanagement and business analysis parts within a software development project.
It emerged from the idea of Test Driven Development (TDD) and domain-driven design, to provide software developers and team managers, thus both technical and non-technical staff with the necessary tools and means of communicating with each other during their collaborative work in the field of software development.

During the BDD workflow in general, the tasks, goals and results of the Software are determined at the beginnning of the Specification analysis and summed up in a text form readable to non-technical staff, which all happens in a Domain Driven Design manner. Afterwards, those specifications of the to be developed software will be translated into automated tests, which is where the TDD approach comes into play. In the end the software developers will implement the features and functionalities of the software such that they pass all the predefined tests. This has as an advantage, that both the technical and non-technical people working on the project know at any point in time which features are inculded in the software so far and who expects what from whom. Furthermore, mostly relevant for the technical staff of the project, this approach to software development, means that the software that has to be developped is already split into smaller parts and thus easier to create, in a divide and conquer approach, which is commonly used in the IT sector, for any larger task.
